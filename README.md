Shark Tank India EDA
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Shark Tank India dataset. The goal is to uncover insights about the deals, industries, entrepreneurs, and investment patterns by cleaning, processing, and visualizing the data.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is Shark Tank India EDA.xlsx, which contains information about pitches, investments, sharks, and deal details.
Key columns include:
Startup/Brand Name
Industry/Domain
Amount Asked & Amount Invested
Equity Offered
Shark(s) involved

🔍 Key Steps in Analysis
1.Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
  Handled missing values and blanks
  Removed duplicate records

2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Distribution of deals across industries
  Amounts invested vs. asked
  Shark-specific investment patterns
  Equity distribution among startups

3.Visualization
  Used Matplotlib & Seaborn to create graphs and charts for better insights

📊 Insights Gained
Which industries attracted the most deals
Average investment and equity trends
Sharks’ preferences in terms of industries and funding amounts
Patterns in negotiations between entrepreneurs and sharks
